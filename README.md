<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Lo-Fi Study Clock

A web tool to combine relaxing Lo-Fi beats with an ever lurking clock! Keep yourself on time when studying or working using the Lo-Fi Study Clock, with built in To-Do list and timer.

What you can do:
* Listen to some relaxed Lo-Fi beats or add your own YouTube playlist.
* Add your projects or tasks to the built in to-do list and know that they'll still be there if you refresh or close the site.
* Start the timer and keep an eye on how long your spending on each task.

Of-course, no Lo-Fi app would be complete without some satisfying animations, see you can find all of them!
